        <p>
            I am a software tester with a focus primarily on embedded systems. This project is being developed for educational purposes to expand my skills in web development and software testing related to web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site uses a script I created to manage the overpayment of my own loan. If time allows, I plan to further develop this project, and who knowsâ€”it may eventually be published somewhere (thatâ€™s the plan for now)!
        </p>
        <p>
            So, wish me luck! ðŸ˜Š
